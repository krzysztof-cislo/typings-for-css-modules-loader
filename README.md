# typings-for-css-modules-loader

Webpack loader that generates TypeScript typings for CSS modules from css-loader on the fly

## Disclaimer

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/TeamSupercell/typings-for-css-modules-loader

It changes the way how types are generated due to problems with typescript imports
